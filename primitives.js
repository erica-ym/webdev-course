//primitive data types in javascript

//there are 5 primitive data types
//numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined

//double and single quotes ok
//string concatenation works

print("hello.world").length
print("she said \"goodbye \" ") 
//that backslash is an escape character
//every string you create has a length property

//access individual characters with "hello"[0]
//like array notation
print("javascript"[0])

//what i've learned: string concatenation, length, and basic operations

//welcome to variables

var yourNameHere = "value";
// reassign like this 
yourNameHere = "Sally";

var num = 43;
//can change their value, but you can also change their type
//things in javascript should follow camelCase

//big difference between null and undefined.

var age;
//ask for this back - it's UNDEFINED
//undefined currently doesn't have a value YET

var player = null;
//null means explicitly NOTHING


//introducing methods - alert(); prompt(); console.log();
clear();
//clear is a method that clears the console - think of it as a variable that stores code
alert();
//alert is a method that alerts the user
console.log();
//prints something to the console
